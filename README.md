# agrirouter-user-documentation

The agrirouter is a universal data exchange platform for farmers and agricultural contractors that makes it possible to connect machinery and agricultural software, 
regardless of vendor or manufacturer. agrirouter does not save data; it transfers data. As a universal data exchange platform, agrirouter fills a gap on the way to Farming 4.0. 
Its underlying concept unites cross-vendor and discrimination-free data transfer. You retain full control over your data. Even data exchange with service providers 
(e.g. agricultural contractors) and other partners is uncomplicated: Data are very rapidly transferred via the online connection, and if you wish, 
is intelligently connected to other datasets.
