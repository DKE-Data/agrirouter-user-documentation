|517 |Setpoint Tramline Condensed Work State 1-16 |Guidance and Geo Data |The Setpoint Tramline Condensed Work State DDIs are the control command counterparts to the Actual Tramline Condensed Work States DDIs. The value is a combination of the Setpoint Tramline Valve Work States of individual Tramline Valves number 1 to 16 into a single Setpoint Tramline Condensed Work State of their parent DeviceElement. The Setpoint Tramline Condensed Work State contains the child element Setpoint Tramline Work States, in the driving direction from left to right, where the leftmost child element Setpoint Tramline Work State are the 2 lowest significant bits of the Process Data Value. Each child device elements Setpoint Work State is represented by 2 bits and defined as: 00 = disable/off, 01 = enable/on, 10 = error indicator, 11 = no change. In total 16 child device element Setpoint Tramline Work States can be contained in one Setpoint Tramline Condensed Work State of their parent DeviceElement. If less than 16 child device element Setpoint Tramline Work States are available, then the unused bits shall be set to value 11 (no change).
